# Future Development

I'd love to incorporate a past, present, future function utilizing moment.js to be able to tell whether or not I'm before, currently or ahead of the time. I can safely assume through pseudocoding, that it'd be something like a for loop and/or a if/else statement. Maybe some CSS to add or remove a class/attribute given whether or not it's past, present, future.
