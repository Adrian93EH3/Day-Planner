# User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule <br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner <br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively <br>

# Day-Planner
This project was very fun to make. I loved the challenge and I loved making a planner seeing as I'm a very advocate user of planning/to-do listing.

# Requirements
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule <br>
WHEN I open the planner <br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar <br>
WHEN I scroll down <br>
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours <br>
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day <br>
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future <br>
WHEN I click into a timeblock <br>
THEN I can enter an event <br>
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock <br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage <br>
WHEN I refresh the page <br>
THEN the saved events persist <br>
